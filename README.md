### Step 1: Create the HTML Structure
- Define the basic structure of the calculator using HTML.
- Create a form with buttons for numbers and operations.


### Step 2: Style the Calculator with CSS
- Use CSS to style the calculator for a better user experience.
- Add styles for the table, buttons, and input fields.

### Step 3: Implement Calculator Logic with JavaScript
- Create functions to handle button clicks, clear the screen, and perform calculations.
  - `addToScreen(value)`: Appends the clicked button's value to the current value on the display screen.
  - `clearScreen()`: Clears the display screen.
  - `calculateResult()`: Evaluates the expression on the display screen and shows the result. Displays "Error" for invalid expressions.
